        <h3>About Kai</h3>
        <p>Kai is a 19 year old CS major who uses they/them pronouns. They like to play tabletop and board games, 
            paint, and read comics in their spare time.</p>
        <p>Their go-to fun fact is that they went to circus camp (first in Norwich, then Plainfield) for 6 summers!</p>
        <p>Kai is an avid advocate for social justice, especially LGBTQ rights. 
            They are volunteeeering for NextGen New Hampshire this summer.</p>

        <h3>Why CS 52?</h3>
        <p>Kai is creative and is hoping to be able to use web development in their career. 
            Next term they are going to work at Google and will be doing full stack app development. 
            This class will be really helpful!</p>

        <h3>Other CS skills</h3>
        <p>Kai is about halfway through the CS major. They've taken CS 1, 10, 11/70.01, 30, 50, 65. They have TA'd 
            CS 1 twice and CS 10 once, so like to think of their Python and Java language skills as pretty sharp.</p>
